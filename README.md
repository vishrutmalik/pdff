# pdff

This repository pertains to the work I did for my bachelor's thesis. I know the repository is a mess, but it's because it was a simple collection of small scripts to analyse different sets of planar robot configurations, and an attempt to migrate the Julia implementation to Python in order to perform a standard simulation within a simulator. The main file of interest is pdff_impl.jl which contains all of the important functions to perform a planar robot PDFF manipulation.
