# pdff

This repository pertains to the work I did for my bachelor's thesis. Here, you can find a simple collection of small scripts to analyse different sets of planar robot configurations and an attempt to rewrite the Julia implementation in Python to perform standard simulations within a simulator. The main file of interest is pdff_impl.jl, which contains all the important functions for performing planar robot PDFF manipulation.

The rest of the thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/vishrutmalik/deep-rl-grasping).
